<h4>Hook Nova: Learn, Grow, Live. </h4>

<p>Nova's mission is to facilitate and normalize a healthy relationship and connection between learners and teachers.
At Hook, we believe this connection can break the limits of school, work, or common normal bases. We like to include every moment a person receives content and knowledge from someone else's mind.

We have created Nova willing to normalize a new kind of relationship between the learner and the teacher. We like to think of everyone as someone with a hunger for knowledge and, by that, we feel inspired to develop a platform where you can truly grow.

In Nova, you have access to tools, designed and created by the Hook team, and posts. 

The tools mentioned include To-Do, Timers, Flashcards, Timetables, and more. While these tools can be entirely private, the tools can also be public and you can make them collaborative between your friends or a specific group of people. 
Note for To-Do. "20 of 25 have completed the To-Do "Essay Lit"."

The posts in Nova are powered by an immense source of Books, Movies, and Music. Posts can include text, images, videos, files, web URLs, book references, music references, movie references, coaches promotions, alumni promotions, and coach class reviews.

Each profile has the option to be a coach or a student. However, the person will always have the option to act as a student and contact other coaches, independently of their profile tags. 

The profiles that have chosen to be a Coach can share their experience, education, subjects, and more info with the world, reaching out to tons of students inside the Nova platform. Coaches also have access to a custom Coach Dashboard where they can manage all their students, the content and resources that the Coach is providing to them, the estimated revenue from the Coach classes, the upcoming classes, and much more. 

Students, however, have the opportunity to contact each coach and keep a social relationship with them in the app. Students also have access to a personal Student Dashboard with access to all their classes, their old classes and coaches, and suggestions of new coaches depending on what the user preferences are.

Meanwhile, Alumni Profiles can share with the world their professional and academic experience, highlighting where the person attended his studies, when he finished them, where is he currently working, what notable achievements the profile has, and much more. Each Alumni Profile has access to a private network with people in common. It can be common between universities, schools, work, careers, year of graduation, etc.

It is in our hands to create a platform that includes all these principles, as it is in your hands to help make this project something achievable.
